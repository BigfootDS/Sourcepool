# Getting Started with Sourcepool (For Admins & Dungeon Masters)

It's assumed that a dungeon master (DM) or game master (GM) would be the "admin" of a given Sourcepool server.

If you're a DM/GM and someone else is maintaining the Sourcepool server for you, that's fine - chat with that person about any configuration that is _not_ related to your campaign content.
