# User story

(If the story does not fit or look nice in an issue title, write it out here)

As a ___, I want to ___, because ___.

# Who, what, and why

Per the user story template above, you should have some idea of:
- Who the user story is about
- What the user story adds to the project
- Why the user story needs to add the desired thing to the project

Explain more about each of those points here.

# Dependent features, functions, or pull requests

Does this user story require anything to be implemented or completed first? List that here. 
This can be empty at first, but should absolutely gain dependencies as the user story is implemented.
