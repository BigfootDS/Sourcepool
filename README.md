# Sourcepool
TTRPG content management system, ready for you to self-host.

## In a nutshell...

This system is like [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), but for tabletop RPG management. 

- Game masters can set up their content in their self-hosted Sourcepool
- Players can access content from their GM's Sourcepool

The owners of a Sourcepool instance are responsible for their own content management. 
This system just provides a heap of tools to make that management easier.

## Repositories

- [Sourcepool]() - an overview of the system.
- [Sourcepool-Server]() - the back-end server of the system.
- [Sourcepool-Client-Web]() - a front-end interface of the system, used in the web browser.
