# Sourcepool
TTRPG content management system, ready for you to self-host.

## In a nutshell...

This system is like [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), but for tabletop RPG management. 

- Game masters can set up their content in their self-hosted Sourcepool
- Players can access content from their GM's Sourcepool

The owners of a Sourcepool instance are responsible for their own content management. 
This system just provides a heap of tools to make that management easier.

## Documentation

Please visit the Sourcepool website for documentation and information:

- [https://bigfootds.github.io/Sourcepool/](https://bigfootds.github.io/Sourcepool/)

## Repositories

- [Sourcepool](https://github.com/BigfootDS/Sourcepool/) - an overview of the system, and the documentation website.
- [Sourcepool-Server](https://github.com/BigfootDS/Sourcepool-Server) - the back-end server of the system.
- [Sourcepool-Client-Web]() - (Coming soon!) a front-end interface of the system, used in the web browser.
